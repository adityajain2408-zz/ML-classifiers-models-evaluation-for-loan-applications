# ML-classifiers-models-evaluation-for-loan-applications
The porject contains a Jupyter notebook on Python. 

A historical dataset from previous loan applications is loaded, data is cleaned, and different classification algorithm on the data. Following machine learning algorithms were used to build your models:
• k-Nearest Neighbour
• Decision Tree
• Support Vector Machine
• Logistic Regression
The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier were applied, using the following metrics when applicable:  
• Jaccard index
• F1-score
• LogLoss
