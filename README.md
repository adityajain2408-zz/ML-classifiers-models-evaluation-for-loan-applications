# ML-classifiers-models-evaluation-for-loan-applications
The project contains a Jupyter notebook leveraging Python 3.6 with scikit-learn. 

A historical dataset from previous loan applications is loaded, data is cleaned, and different classification algorithm are applied on the data. 

The machine learning algorithms used to build the models are follows:

• k-Nearest Neighbour

• Decision Tree

• Support Vector Machine

• Logistic Regression


The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier were evaluated, using the following metrics when applicable:  

• Jaccard index

• F1-score

• LogLoss
